# my-pseudocode #

This project is designed for students at Awesome Inc U. to become accustomed to Pseudocode and the value it adds to a programmer's arsenal when problem solving. This particular pseudocode will take users through a program on how to wash their hands from variable to declaration all the way to execution using strictly markdown and pseudocode.
